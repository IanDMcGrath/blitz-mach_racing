# Background

This is my Three.js break-in project where I'll be leveraging my prior 3D experience to build my favorite kind of racing game and I hope you'll enjoy.


MachBlitz is all about high speeds and tight controls. If you've got an issue with the game, please shoot me a message.

# Implementation Timeline
- After review, this was a very hopeful development timeline

* Friday Afternoon & Weekend
	- three.js working in browser
	- models & materials can be imported
	- scene global lighting and skybox/skysphere
	- vehicle class associated with model and updates model's position in the scene
	- world block-out // road mesh / vehicle mesh / starting-line w/ banner mesh
* Monday
	- player input influences vehicle movement
	- viewport camera follows vehicle
	- vehicle acceleration
	- vehicle gravity
	- vehicle respects the floor plane
	- vehicle respects the road mesh
* Tuesday
	- race start
	- timer on HUD
	- race end
	- lap system (?)
	- adjust scene meshes, the car moves now so the level should cater to it
	- dummy ai (it just drives forward) <- where I got ahead of myself and had to begin defering work
	- race starting positions
	- racer shoving and collision responses
* Wednesday
	- death and respawn (fall off track -> return to track)
	- ai ensmarten (points towards race finish without disrespecting road mesh)
	- points system
	- points on HUD
	- race finish podium
	- add animations to vehicle (wheels turn? jets boost?)
	- add particle effects (dirt trails) (confetti cannons) (race flag waver)
	- add sounds (?)
	- add music (?)
* Thursday Morning
	- safety day / last minute tweaking / upload beans
